# Tunnel-lining-disease-image
This is the lining surface disease data set for a tunnel in terms of corroded bolts.
The dataset is in the format of VOC. 
***Annotations*** contains the ground truth of the bolt detection task. 
***SegmentationClass*** contains the ground truth of the corrosion area of bolts, which is used for the segmentation task.
The data can be accessible on Baidu Cloud Disk. The link is https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pfuVMqPkxKCOCMChBgoShw. The extraction code is A2n8.
Our paper focusing on corroded bolt detection: DMDSNet: A Computer Vision-based Dual Multi-task Model for Tunnel Bolt Detection and Corrosion Segmentation.
